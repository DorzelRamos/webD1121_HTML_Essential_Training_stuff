    <h1>The HTML page</h1>
    <h2>The HTML File</h2>
    <dd>The first file thats returned in response to a request for a webpage</dd>
    <p>When starting the HTML page there's several key items you need for it.</p>
    <h3>doctype decleration</h3>
    <p>The doctype decleration is what declares which era the HTML file is from.</p>
    <h3>The head element</h3>
    <p>The head element contains info the browser needs to know, but doesn't display it on the page</p>
    <h3>The body element</h3>
    <p>The body element containst he info and the content that will be displayed on the page</p>
    <h2>What goes in the document head?</h2>
    <p>The <b>meta element</b> only gose inside the head element. It conveys the meta data of the page.</p>
    <p>Then theres the <b>title</b> which gives the browser the webpages name.</p>
    <p>The <b>link element</b> is used to link to a range of other assets that we want to load.</p>
    <p>The <b>rel attribute</b> tells the browser whihc kind of asset it is.</p>
    <p>The <b>href attribute</b> provides the URL to the asset.</p>
    <p>The <b>script element</b> is what's used to tell the browser to load in the JavaScript file.
    It doesn't have to go inside the head, it can be at the end of the HTML after everything is loaded.</p>

    <h2>What goes in the rest?</h2>
    <p>Here's what builds the structure.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>main</li>
        <p>Only used once per page</p>
        <li>header</li>
        <p>Different from the head</p>
        <li>footer</li>
        <p>Placed at the end</p>
        <li>article</li>
        <p>Wraps around instances of articles. A unit of content</p>
        <li>section</li>
        <p>Good for essays or zones for a webpage</p>
        <li>aside</li>
        <p>Things when its not part of the main content</p>
    </ul>
