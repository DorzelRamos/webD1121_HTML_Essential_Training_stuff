    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>When you want to put an image in a website you use a <b>IMG element</b></p>
    <h3> There are four attributes important to make an image:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The source attribute <b>src</b></li>
        <li>The alt attribute <b>alt</b></li>
        <li>The <b>width</b> attribute</li>
        <li>The <b>height</b> attribute</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>SRC attribute</h4>
    <dd>Tells the browser which file to load for the image to show up</dd>

    <h4>ALT attribute</h4>
    <dd>Acts as the placeholder whenever the image can't be seen. You can write about the image here</dd>

    <h4>width attribute</h4>
    <dd>Displays the images width. Can be in px, cm, inch, etc. Doesn't matter which goes first width or height</dd>

    <h4>height attribute</h4>
    <dd>Displayst he images height. Can be in px, cm, inch, etc. Doesn't matter which goes first height or width</dd>

    <h3>The image formats</h3>
    <p>To put an image on a webpage it has to be a file the browser will understand. The <i>goal</i> is to have 
    the highest quality photo in a small file size.</p>
    <h4>There are <b>four main files</b> that are commonly used:</h4>
    <h4> GIF </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Really good for compressing large colors</li>
            <li>Has limited space of 256 colors</li>
            <li>Can do transparency</li>
            <li> Can have multiple frames and make short movies</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>SVG (Scalable vector graphic)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Good for logos, icons, etc.</li>
            <li> Good for vector files</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>JPG (for compressing photos</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Can be compressed</li>
            <li>Size vs Quality</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>PNG (more new than GIF and JPG)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For images that need transparency</li>
            <li>Good at compression</li>
            <li>Good for photos and images</li>
            <li>Depends when to use</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Responsive Images</h3>
        <p>You can use HTML to send the same photo to different screens in different sizes.
            This works by leting the browser decide which file size is right for the device by giving
            it options. There's 1x, 2x, 3x, and so on and so forth.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>You could also tell the browser to pick the image photos by device density and viewport width.</p>
        <h4>The size attributes for image elements</h4>
        <dd>This lists which size image to use at which media querty</dd>

        <h4>The srcset attributes for image elements</h4>
        <dd>Allows you to specify mutiple files to be used based on either viewport width or image px width</dd>

        <h4> The picture element</h4>
        <dd>If you wrap an <b>img element</b> with a <b>picture element</b> you can decide which source
        elements to use for it.</dd>
