    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>To write a link you use an <i>anchor element</i>, or a. It's written
        with an href, then you put an ="site page" and then add a link at the end. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The <i>href</i> stands for <b>Hypertext reference</b>. You can also wrap
        text around links. You can even put other URLs inside the anchor element to link to other 
    websites. <i>HTTP</i> stands for <b>Hypertext protocol</b>. <i>HTTPS</i> stands for Hyperlink Secure.</p>
    <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
    <p>Heres an example. It's a link that will take you to Youtube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRPQs_kM_nw"> Its a dancing cow!</a></p>
    <!--Remember! When you put the name of the link, you do it outside it's angled brakets!-->
    
    <h3>URL Paths</h3>
    <p>Whenever we use a link on the same domain and same website, you can use whats called
        a <b>relative URL</b> to locate the files on the website. An <b>absolute URL</b>
        is where all the files are in the domain.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> To make a URL from scratch you have to understand how files are organized. Certain techniques
        to organize files only work in HTML.
    </p> 
    <br>
    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <h4>The nav element</h4>
    <p>When you wrap a list of items with a nav element it tells the website that the items
        are part of the navigation bar.
    </p>
    <h3>EXAMPLE</h3>
    <nav>
        <ul>
            <li> One </li>
            <li> Two </li>
            <li> Three </li>
            <p>Check the inspect!</p>
        </ul>
